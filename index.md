<h2 id="about-me"> About Me</h2>

I am an undergraduate Computer Science & Systems student at the University of Washington Tacoma.  
My main interests include:

- Software engineering  
- Object-oriented programming  
- Debugging and problem-solving  
- Building structured, efficient applications  

**Career Goals:**  
I plan to continue building experience in software engineering, system design, and full-stack development while preparing for internships and long-term career opportunities in tech.

**Motivation:**  
I’m driven by curiosity, the desire to solve complex problems, and the satisfaction of turning ideas into real, functional programs.

**Additional Interests:**  
- Mathematics & logic puzzles  
- Learning new programming tools  
- Improving personal projects each quarter

> This section will grow over time. I will update it each quarter as I complete new coursework and personal projects.

## **1. Road Rage Assignment**  
**Description:**  
The Road Rage assignment is a Java-based simulation project designed to model how different vehicle types behave on a grid-based map. Each vehicle (car, truck, human, taxi, etc.) follows specific rules for movement, collisions, interactions, and direction choices. The project focuses heavily on object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and clean class design.

**Technologies:** Java, Object-Oriented Programming, Interfaces & Abstract Classes, JUnit Testing, IntelliJ  
**Repository:** _To be added_  

**Key Learnings:**  
- Strengthened OOP skills using inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.  
- Improved class design, organization, and reusable code structure.  
- Practiced debugging complex interactions between vehicle behaviors.  
- Gained experience reading and implementing detailed project specifications.  
- Built confidence working with JUnit tests and simulation logic.
