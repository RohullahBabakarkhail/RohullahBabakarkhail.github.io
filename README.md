> This section will grow over time. I will update it each quarter as I complete new coursework and personal projects.

## **1. Road Rage Assignment**  
**Description:**  
The Road Rage assignment is a Java-based simulation project designed to model how different vehicle types behave on a grid-based map. Each vehicle (car, truck, human, taxi, etc.) follows specific rules for movement, collisions, interactions, and direction choices. The project focuses heavily on object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and clean class design.

**Technologies:** Java, Object-Oriented Programming, Interfaces & Abstract Classes, JUnit Testing, IntelliJ  
**Repository:** _To be added_  

**Key Learnings:**  
- Strengthened OOP skills using inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.  
- Improved class design, organization, and reusable code structure.  
- Practiced debugging complex interactions between vehicle behaviors.  
- Gained experience reading and implementing detailed project specifications.  
- Built confidence working with JUnit tests and simulation logic.
