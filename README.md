## About Me

I am an undergraduate Computer Science and Systems student at the University of Washington Tacoma. My interests include:

- Software engineering  
- Object-oriented programming  
- Debugging and problem solving  
- Building clean and structured applications  
- Learning new technologies  

I enjoy working on Java-based projects, simulations, algorithms, and applications that challenge me to think critically and design logically. My long-term goal is to gain experience in software engineering roles and work on real-world systems.

## Featured Project

### Road Rage — Java Vehicle Simulation

A simulation project that models how different vehicles behave on a grid-based map. Each vehicle type (car, truck, human, taxi, and others) follows specific rules for movement, collisions, and direction decisions.

Key Learnings:
- Strengthened understanding of inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism  
- Improved class design and code organization  
- Practiced debugging interactions between many classes  
- Used JUnit testing during development  
- Gained experience reading and implementing detailed specifications  

Technologies: Java, IntelliJ, JUnit, Object-Oriented Programming
